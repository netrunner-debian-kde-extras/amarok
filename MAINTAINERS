Amarok does not have clear maintainers of any part of the codebase. You are welcome to work on any part of it provided you coordinate with others working in that part.

If you need to contact someone about a particular part it is best to contact the developer mailing list at amarok-devel@kde.org or the assignee of the corresponding component on http://bugs.kde.org directly.
