This package uses git as the packaging VCS. Branch structure of the repository
is as follows:

* upstream   - upstream source code.
* master     - the Debianization branch (upstream source and debian directory).
               This branch also contains exported debian/patches ready for
               building.

All members of Debian KDE Extras team are permitted to do maintainer uploads
that fix RC bugs. Please consult package uploaders before doing/committing
other kind of changes.
