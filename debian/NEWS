amarok (2.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

    When upgrading from earlier version of the 2.x series, fully rescan local
    collection (Menu -> Settings -> Configure Amarok -> Collection -> Fully
    Rescan Collection) and restart Amarok. Otherwise, you may experience weird
    problems like 0:00 track lengths. See README.Debian for more information.

amarok (2.1.80-1) experimental; urgency=low

    Amarok database schema has changed in 2.2 Beta 1. Therefore, once you run
    Amarok 2.2, you won't be able to downgrade back to Amarok 2.1 without
    losing your local collection or restoring 2.1 compatible database files
    from backup.

amarok (1.98-1) experimental; urgency=low

    Amarok 2 features Amarok 1.4 collection importer since 1.94 (2.0 Beta 3).
    Read /usr/share/doc/amarok/README.Debian for more information.

    Amarok 2 MySQLe collection storage should be stable now and you should
    not lose your collection after future updates anymore.

amarok (1.92-1) experimental; urgency=low

    Now Amarok uses MySQL Embedded (MySQLe) as its default collection database
    engine. However, as of 2.0 Beta 2 (this release), there is no migration
    path provided from the old SQLite based database to the new MySQLe based
    one although this feature is planned for later Amarok 2 (pre)releases. This
    effectively means that you will have to rebuild your collection losing all
    ratings and other additional information about tracks you have collected
    with 2.0 Beta 1 (1.90).

    It is very likely that the MySQLe backend used by Amarok will change in
    the next releases. Therefore, you might be forced to rebuild your
    collection again in the near future.
