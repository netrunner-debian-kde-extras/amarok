amarok (1.98-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Amarok 2 features Amarok 1.4 collection importer since 1.94 (2.0 Beta 3).
    Read /usr/share/doc/amarok/README.Debian for more information.
  * Amarok 2 MySQLe collection storage should be stable now and you should
    not lose your collection after future updates anymore.

amarok (1.92-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Now Amarok uses MySQL Embedded (MySQLe) as its default collection database
    engine. However, as of 2.0 Beta 2 (this release), there is no migration
    path provided from the old SQLite based database to the new MySQLe based
    one although this feature is planned for later Amarok 2 (pre)releases. This
    effectively means that you will have to rebuild your collection losing all
    ratings and other additional information about tracks you have collected
    with 2.0 Beta 1 (1.90).
  * It is very likely that the MySQLe backend used by Amarok will change in
    the next releases. Therefore, you might be forced to rebuild your
    collection again in the near future.
