/** The ScanManager manages the scanning and directory watching for a DatabaseCollection.

    The scan manager will check the version of the amarokcollectionscanner application,
    watch the collection directories using the KDirWatch and initiate the scanning.

    For the scanning an external process with the scanner is started and the result
    is handled in a seperate thread.

    Notes for the method of checking for changes:
    When Amarok is started we wait a minute (so that the scanner does not slow down
    the application startup) and then we do a full incremental scan.
    After that we use KDirWatch to track directory changes.
    KDirWatch will not track changes to symbolic links!
