	/** Class implementing JSON-RPC.
	 *
	 * This implements the JSON-RPC 2.0 proposal, as of 2008-11-15, located
	 * at http://groups.google.com/group/json-rpc/web/json-rpc-1-2-proposal.
	 *
	 * While 1.1 is more popular for web services, 2.0 is a much simpler
	 * protocol, and is not restricted to HTTP requests.
	 *
	 * Note that 'parameter' QVariant objects must be either null QVariants,
	 * contain a QVariantList, or a QVariantMap. If a QVariantList is used,
	 * it must be a list of all the parameters the method takes, in the
	 * correct order. If a QVariantMap is used, the keys must be strings
	 * exactly matching the parameter names of the method (case-sensitive).
	 *
	 * There are two IO members:
	 * - processJson - slot - parse the JSON string given, and act upon it
	 * - sendJson - signal - an action that an instance of JsonRpc has been
	 *   told to do requires that the specified JSON be sent to the other
	 *   peer.
	 *
	 * All other members are interfaces to JSON-RPC.
	 *
	 * 'id' parameters SHOULD NOT be NULL, for reasons defined in the
	 * specification. Also, it SHOULD be a scalar.
	 *
