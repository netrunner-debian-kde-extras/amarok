//      Some of the public methods are virtual but not pure. The implementations of those
//      are inline, and are dummies (if they return anything, they return default values).
//      Almost all of them are reimplemented in Playlist::ProxyBase anyway, so the only
//      reason why they are not pure virtual is that this would require the dummies to
//      exist in Playlist::Model, which just looks wrong.
//      These methods are needed because even though they don't do anything in Playlist::
//      Model, they are important parts of the interface that a complete playlist model
//      must implement. Non trivial implementations are handled by the proxies, and they
//      are used in the view(s), Playlist::Controller, Playlist::Actions and probably in
//      many other places.  --Téo 19/7/2009
