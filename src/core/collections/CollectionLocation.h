/**
    This base class defines the the methods necessary to allow the copying and moving
    of tracks between different collections in a generic way.

    This class should be used as follows in client code:
    - select a source and a destination CollectionLocation
    - call prepareCopy or prepareMove on the source CollectionLocation
    - forget about the rest of the workflow

    Implementations which are writeable must reimplement the following methods
    - prettyLocation()
    - isWritable()
    - remove( Meta::Track )
    - copyUrlsToCollection( QMap<Meta::TrackPtr, KUrl> )

    Writable collections that are also organizable should reimplement isOrganizable().
    Organizable means that the user is able to decide (to varying degrees, the details
    depend on the actual collection) where the files are stored in the filesystem (or some
    kind of VFS). An example would be the local collection, where the user can select the directory
    structure that Amarok uses to store the files. An example for a writable collection that is not
    organizable are ipods, where the user has no control about the actual location of the music files
    (they are automatically stored in a not human-readable form).

    Implementations which are only readable can reimplement getKIOCopyableUrls( Meta::TrackList )
    if it is necessary, but can use the default implementations if possible.

    Implementations that have a string expressable location(s), such as a URL or path on disk
    should reimplement actualLocation().

    Implementations that need additional information provided by the user have to implement
    showSourceDialog() and showDestinationDialog(), depending on whether the information is required
    in the source, the destination, or both.

    The methods will be called in the following order:
    startWorkflow (source)
    showSourceDialog (source) (reimplementable)
    slotShowSourceDialogDone (source)
    slotPrepareOperation (destination)
    showDestinationDialog (destination) (reimplementable)
    slotShowDestinationDialogDone (destination)
    slotOperationPrepared (source)
    getKIOCopyableUrls (source) (reimplementable)
    slotGetKIOCopyableUrlsDone (source)
    slotStartCopy (destination)
    copyUrlsToCollection (destination) (reimplementable)
    slotCopyOperationFinished (destination)
    slotFinishCopy (source)

    To provide removal ability, it is required to reimplement removeUrlsFromCollection,
    and this function must call slotRemoveOperationFinished() when it is done.  Optionally,
    showRemoveDialog can be reimplemented to customize the warning displayed before a removal,
    and this function must call slotShowRemoveDialogDone when finished.

    The methods for remove will be called in the following order:
    startRemoveWorkflow
    showRemoveDialog (reimplementable)
    slotShowRemoveDialogDone
    slotStartRemove
    removeUrlsFromCollection (reimplementable)
    slotRemoveOperationFinished
    slotFinishRemove
